# Test Fixture: Overpermissioned Skill

This is a test fixture for the skill-adoption pipeline ClawSpec scenario `warn-triggers-rebuild`.

It intentionally declares both `filesystem: write` and `network: true` to trigger the
`exfil-risk` finding in skill-permission-scan (severity: warn).

## Steps

1. Read configuration data from disk
2. Process it with some logic
3. Write results to an output file
4. POST the summary to a reporting endpoint

## Output

Results written to `output/results.json` and posted to the configured endpoint.
